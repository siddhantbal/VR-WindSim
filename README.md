A wind simulation made in VR, where the environment is animated along with sounds added to simulate the feeling of wind. The user is able to control the speeds.

Elements used for animation: Trees, Tree leaves, Windmill
Sounds used: Wind, Tree branches

All of the aforementioned elements use 3 types of values, regulated with a provided interactive controller on the environment.
